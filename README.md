## Requirements
The B.S. degree in Applied Mathematics requires the completion of a minimum of 128 credit hours of acceptable coursework with cumulative and major grade point averages of C (2.25) or better. Students must complete the following minimum requirements:

### General
* Calculus Requirement: Three semesters of Calculus in either the APPM or MATH department.
  * APPM 1350/MATH 1300
  * APPM 1360/MATH 2300
  * APPM 2350/MATH 2400

* Computing Requirement: One of the below.
  * CSCI 1300
  * GEEN 1300
  * ECEN 1310

* Science Requirement:
  * PHYS 1110, 1120, and 1140
  * 5 additional credit hours (including 2 credits of laboratory science) from one of the following:
    * CHEN 1211 and CHEM 1221
    * CHEM 1113 and CHEM 1114
    * EBIO 1210, 1220, 1230, and 1240
    * MCDB 1150, 1151, 2150, and 2151

* _Note to IUT students: Students choosing options 3c or 3d must be enrolled in (or have completed) PHYS 1120 at the time of their IUT application._

* Course Requirements: One of the following
  _Note: Students who have completed MATH 3000, 3200, or 4130 have satisfied this requirement._
  * APPM 2360 (Differential Equations with Linear Algebra.)
  * APPM 3310 (Matrix Methods)
  * APPM 4350 (Methods in Applied Mathematics I)
  * APPM 4360 (Methods in Applied Mathematics II)
  * APPM 4650 (Intermediate Numerical Analysis I)
  * APPM 4440 or MATH 3001 or MATH 3140

* Two-Semester Course Sequence:
  A two semester course sequence of applied mathematics or mathematics courses numbered 4000 or above in addition to APPM 4350 and 4360.

  Possible sequences include:
  * APPM 4650/4660
  * APPM 4570/4580
  * APPM 4560/4520
  * APPM 4440/4450
  * APPM 4380/4390
  * APPM 3570 and APPM 4520/APPM 4560

* Other:
  A minimum of 24 credits in applied mathematics or mathematics courses numbered 3000 or above (including the required courses). No more than 3 credits of APPM 4840 may count towards these 24. No more than six credits of independent study are allowed for credit towards the BS in Applied Math.

  A minimum of 24 credits in engineering courses (or approved courses with significant mathematical content in A&S or Business) with at least 15 credits in courses numbered 2000 or above and at least 6 credits in courses numbered 3000 or above.  These 24 credits are in addition to those required credits listed in numbers 2 and 3 (mentioned above). Several possible options are listed on the following pages

  Humanities and Social Sciences requirements of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (18 credits), which includes a 3 credit writing requirement. Students may satisfy the writing requirement by taking HUEN 1010 (first-year freshmen only), WRTG 3030, WRTG 3035, HUEN 3100, or PHYS 3050. Humanities and social science electives must not be limited to a selection of unrelated introductory courses.  At least 9 credit hours must be at the 3000-level or above. A complete list of courses that can be used to satisfy this requirement can be found at http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/academics/policies/hss.
