* **Note:** I'm going to take **APPM 3170** to satisfy this requirement.

Complete:  
  * [ ] **CSCI 2270** (4) Computer Science 2: Data Structures (with a grade of C- or better)
  * [ ] **CSCI 2400**, Computer Systems. Grade of C- or better.

## Theoretical Standing
If all goes according to plan, I'll graduate with a B.S. in Applied Math and a minor in Computer Science in 2020. I'll have earned:
* 129 credit hours
* 27 CSCI credit hours (enough for the minor)
* 28 humanities and social sciences credit hours
* 10 science credits (2 of which are labs)
