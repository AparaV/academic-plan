* At least 9 credit hours must be numbered 3000+
* A complete list of courses that can be used to satisfy this requirement can be found at http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/academics/policies/hss

## Theoretical Standing
If all goes according to plan, I'll graduate with a B.S. in Applied Math and a minor in Computer Science in 2020. I'll have earned:
* 129 credit hours
* 27 CSCI credit hours (enough for the minor)
* 28 humanities and social sciences credit hours
* 10 science credits (2 of which are labs)
